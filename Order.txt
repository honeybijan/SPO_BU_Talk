MIXTURES
MixtureModels.py - DAG and Generative Process, Graph of 3 gaussians, then X graph

CAUSALITY
CausalHeterogeneity.py - Antibiotics (heterogeneity is virus, unconfounded, then confounded by doctors choice), Vaccines
FundimentalProblem.py - Exchangeability, ITE and ATE
RCTsInstruments.py - R part, C part refines
ClassicTechniques.py - Covariate adjustments define a metric under which randomization is not needed because everythign is exchangeable
ClusteringCATEs.py - Disjoint regions now CATEs, how to do overlap due to unobserved confounding (non-deterministic as a function of covariates)
    ATE_Subset_HTE.py - Maybe include, then return to do the colorblind PartitionAndOverlap, then back to suggest existance of MTE?

SYNTHETIC POTENTIAL OUTCOMES
TensorMTE.py
Identifiability <- Skip Steps animation
SPO_ATE.py - citation Miao
SPO_MTE.py - second moments 
Coins.py
FullHierarchy.py - 
    Overlap (1 vs 2 boundary) has implications for expanding causal methods, and privacy
    Mixture vs MTE (2 vs 3 boundary) points towards a fundimental granularity for scientific classification
    MTE vs ATE - difference is a conditionally independent sample, which is interestingly the opposite of an instrument
    Add Rectangle for Identifying Existance of MTE, move around
FinalThoughts.py   
    Importance of the Granularity Identifiability - Dont Under identify, dont over identify
    Importance of Sample Complexity
